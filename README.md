# **Training Zones Calculator**

This is a simple Android App written in Kotlin that allows to calculate your own training zones based
on different metrics. You can calculate your Body Mass Index, too.

From the initial screen you can navigate to the BMI calculator, to the Help Screen, or choose if you
want to calculate your zones for cycling or for running.

## **Training Zones**

There are 3 methods for each sport

- Max Heart Rate: with 5 zones
- Lactate Theshold: (based in heart rate) with 7 zones
- FTP: For cycling this means Functional Threshold Power, is based in your power and has 6 zones and
  for running, means Functional Threshold Pace, that is based in your pace and has 7 zones

## **BMI Calculator**

Here you can choose the system you want to use (metric or imperial)

Then you only need to type your height and weight and hit the Calculate button.
